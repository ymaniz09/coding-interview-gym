# Sorted Squared Array
Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers that are sorted in ascending order and returns a new array of the same length with the squares of the original integers also sorted in ascending order.

### Sample Input
````shell
array = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]
````

### Sample Output
````shell
[1, 4, 9, 25, 36, 64, 81]
````

## Optimal Space &amp; Time Complexity
O(n) time | O(n) space - where n is the length of the input array
